 Synopsis:
        double
        dvwind_ds(w,p) finds the gradient velocity vector v, e.g. dvds for the wind 
        coordinates at the position of the photon p.

 Arguments:
        WindPtr w;
        PhotPtr p;

Returns:
        dvds    on successful completion
                the value of where in grid if the photon outside the wind grid.

Description:

Notes:

History:
    01dec	ksl	Coding began, as a result of finding 
			features in output spectra that were 
			due to a discontinuous dv/ds.
	02jan	ksl	Fixed problem in which photons below the
			disk plane were not being dealt with 
			consistently to those above the plane
	04aug	ksl	52a -- Revised to allow for multiple
			coordinate systems and to use the same
			fractional position routines as most
			other portions of python.  Also rewrote
			so more nearly resembles those programs.
	05apr	ksl	55d -- Modified to accept new version
			of coord_fraction, which is much more
			coordinate system independent
	06may	ksl	57+ -- There is no point in transferring
			entire wind to dvwind_ds when we have
			wmain
    1411    JM -- use on the fly method for spherical coordinates
            to avoid problems. This should be improved. See notes
            below and #118

   History:
	98	ksl	Coded
	98dec	ksl	Modified so it calulates a length ds which is
			appropriate to the cell size
	02feb	ksl	Added code to find the direction of maximum velocity
			gradient, and also to assure that in calculating dvds_ave
			the pseudo photon pp did not cross the plane of the
			disk.
	04aug	ksl	52a -- Corrected basic error in dvds_ave.  Previous values
			were 10x too large
	05apr	ksl	55d -- Modified to use w[].xcen rather than mid_x and
			mid_z.  This was necessary for rtheta and spherical
			coordinates.  
	05jul	ksl	56d -- Routine was attempting to calcuate vwind_xyz
			outside of the grid on occassion.  This can be a problem, 
			if the result is really wrong.  I have simply tried to
			address this in vwind, which really means vwind always
			needs to produce a plausible result, which in turn
			means that coord_frac must always produce a reasonable
			result.
	05jul	ksl	Added DEBUG statements to limit creation of dvds.diag
			in cases where not needed.  
	06may	ksl	57+ -- Have not changed except to fix call since it is
			claimed that one needs this everywhere.
	0903	ksl	68c -- This routine appears to have been wrotng since
			at least the last time it was changed, although it is
			not clear what the effect of the error was.  pp was not
			intialized in the statements below
